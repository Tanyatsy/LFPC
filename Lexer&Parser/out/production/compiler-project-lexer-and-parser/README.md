# COS 341 - Lexer

Repository for the compiler construction practical project.

## Proposed classes

### Main

In this file we will deal with details such as reading the input file, invoking
the Lexer class, and possibly writing the serialized linked list file.

### Lexer

The lexer will read a stream of text and identify tokens. The lexer will further
construct a linked list data structure for the tokens and pass this back to the
class that invoked the lexer.
